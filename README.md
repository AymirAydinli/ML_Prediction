# ML_Prediction


### Introduction

To draw inference about whether factors like gender of the student, the race/ethnicity of the student, the level of education of their parents, the type of lunch they ate and whether the completition of test preparation course has any impact on the scores obtained by the student in the tests.

Some of the questions that this analysis will try to answer are:

Does the gender of student plays a role in how they perform in various courses.
Does the educational background of the parents impact the students performance.
Does the ethnicity of the student has an impact on their performance.
Is completing the Test Preparation course help the students in performing better.
Does the quality of lunch the students consume leaves an impact on how they perform.
Finally, a model will be trained to predict how the students will perform given the factors influencing their performance and will also evaluate the performance of the model.
